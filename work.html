          <h3>2D Line Movement</h3>
          <div class="col-md-4">
            <p>This was the very first assignment in my first studio class! It is a line project from 2D Design, in which we explored abstract lines and their different compositions in various patterns. It was also an introduction to using traditional materials.</p><p>All the lines (the black areas) were cut out from black paper with a x-acto knife and glued onto a white matte board with rubber cement. It was the first time I used these materials!</p>

          <h3>Pictograms</h3>
          <div class="col-md-4">
            <p>The Pictogram assignment was the first project in my Pictures for Communication class. The class focused heavily on communicating our design ideas clearly and effectively, while maintaining high visual interest.</p>
            <p>We were given a set list of cat, bird, and insect, and were instructed to design a set of these three animals. I started with the cat's design, and once that was finalized, I created the bird and insect based on the visual style and language of the cat. They all use round, soft edges with a negative space that takes up a part of the body.</p>
            <p>This was a project that was more difficult to execute than it sounds, but I really enjoyed it and I'm happy with what I've come up with!</p>

          <img src="img/card-friendshipinside.png" class="img-rounded" width="45%">
          <br><br><p>One of our assignments in my Licensed Image class was to create a set of greeting cards that could potentially be printed at a stationary store.</p>
          <p>From a set list of themes, we were to pick the ones we found appealing and design a card based on that theme. This card was for "friendship", and utilizes a cut-out window to reveal the rain on the inside page.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
          <h3>Greeting Card - Motivation</h3>
          <img src="img/card-motivationcover.png" class="img-rounded" width="45%">
          <img src="img/card-motivationinside.png" class="img-rounded" width="45%">
          <br><br><p>This is another greeting card from the same Licensed Image assignment, for the theme "motivation"</p>
          <p>My professors prefer that we use Adobe Illustrator because of the vector properties, but I wanted to experiment with textures and rendering, and so this card was created on Photoshop to give it a dreamy effect. I am sure there is a way to create similar effects on Illustrator, but I find Photoshop easier for rendering.</p>

      <div class="col-md-12">
          <h3>Patterns - Forest, Ocean, Sky</h3>
          <div class="col-md-4">
            <p>Another project from Licensed Image, in which we were to design images that could be repeated to create a pattern.</p>
            <p>Although there was no theme for this project, the three patterns needed to work as a set. As a result, I decided to go with nature themes of forest, ocean, and sky.</p>
            <p>Each pattern features an "island" with two human characters interacting on the island. I liked the idea that the "island", which could be a fungus, an animal, or celestial object, provided a base for the characters and patter, and were designed to fit their respective themes.</p>

          <br><br><img src="img/type-book2.jpg" class="img-rounded" width="90%">

          <br><br><img src="img/type-book5.jpg" class="img-rounded" width="90%">
          <br><br><p>For my Typography & Letterform class' final project, we had to create our own modular typeface which included a full alphabet as well as a set of numbers and punctuation. My typeface is named and based after the tangram puzzle, in which 7 geometric shapes are placed together to create different images.</p>
          <p>This project underwent a long process of designing the typeface to creating a typeface poster using a pronto plate and printing press. Finally, we were to create a Type Specimen Book to showcase the typeface (the images shown above are a few pages from my specimen book).</p>
          <p>It was a fun project that I really enjoyed because we leanred how to use the printing press and do some bookbinding in the process. Most of all, it tied together all the concepts we learned throughout the semester while giving us the flexibility to see what we could do with the skills we had acquired.</p>

          <h3>Cup Design</h3>
          <img src="img/cup.png" class="img-rounded" width="95%">
          <br><br><p>Another assignment from Licensed Image (this class was heavily focused on designing for things that could be used or sold as practical products).</p>
          <p>This project involved designing various types of dinnerware that worked as a set. I chose to work on a set of cups, which I have designed according to the basic elements of water, wind, fire, and earth.</p>
          <h3>Album Cover</h3>
          <img src="img/album-cover.jpg" class="img-rounded" width="45%">
          <img src="img/album-back.jpg" class="img-rounded" width="45%">
          <br><br><p>The album cover assignment was from my Communication Design I class. Each student picked a specific band album from a hat (so selections are random!) and were to re-design the cover of the album. Back before digital music downloads became mainstream, album designs were a way for the artist to convey more about themselves and the music. Some say that the album design was just as important as the music!</p>
          <p>I picked the album "Surrealistic Pillow" by Jefferson Airplane, which is a popular band from the 60s. In my design, I hoped to capture the dreamy, influenced state of mind that the band members and its fans were often in, and the associations from that time period.
          <h3>A Short Comic Event</h3>
          <img src="img/comic.jpg" class="img-rounded" width="90%">
          <br><br><p>A recent project from my Pictures for Communication class. We were to create a short narrative that could be told in 9 comic panels without text.</p>
          <p>Like the Pictograms project, it is an assignment that sounds a lot easier than it actually is. To communicate the story effectively and quickly, it was crucial to understand which elements were important to the telling and reading of the story. What design elements were useful and necessary? How do you simplify the design so that the story is clear? Everyone's comics underwent a dramatic overhaul to achieve these goals.</p>
