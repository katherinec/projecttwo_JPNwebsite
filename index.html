We hold a variety of social and cultural events throughout the year to bring people who are passionate about Japanese culture together. Whether you're Japanese, an avid fan of Japanese culture, or someone who just wants to learn more about what we do, don't hesitate to contact us!</p>

          <h3>Club Members</h3>
          <p>At the beginning of every academic semester, we recruit members for our executive board. These are the people who help run the club and host our events. They are expected to attend our weekly meetings in order to stay updated on event planning. General club members who want to connect with people in the club and stay updated about our activities may simply attend our social and cultural events. More information can be found on our Facebook page, or join our newsletter to receive monthly updates!</p>

  Welcome to Katherine's Website
  I'm learning the basics of web development so I wanted to create a website to showcase myself and my skills.

  I was born on September 16, 1992, in California. However, not longer after I was born, my family moved to Singapore, where I have spent the majority of my life. Now, I'm back in the US for college, going to school at Washington University in St. Louis, on track to receive a Bachelors in Business Administration. Being born in California but growing up in Singapore, and now going to school in the US makes me feel lost; they call us "Third Culture Kids" (google it!). I plan on staying in the US after I graduate, so I welcome any and all job opportunities that are located in the US! Even though I'm majoring in Finance and Marketing, I'm not entirely sure what exactly I want to do post-graduation. I will have some tough decisions ahead as I get closer to graduation.I am a freelance photographer. I picked up photography as a hobby and now I love taking pictures wherever I go! Now, I hope to pursue a career in the photography industry.

  Hi there, my name is Katherine Chen and you've found my personal website! I'm a current senior studying Marketing (major) and Communications Design (minor) at Washington University in St. Louis. I enjoy bringing my business and art knowledge together and using my passion for both areas to create well-designed business solutions, while continuing to explore and develop my skills. As someone who was born in the US but grew up in Asia, I consider my background somewhat confusing, but it has also allowed me to appreciate the nuances of different parts of life. All the experiences I have gone through inspire my work and what I do today. I also hope to continue growing and learning even in the future!
