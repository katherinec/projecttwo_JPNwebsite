          <p>Hi there, and welcome to Katherine’s website!</p>

          <p>I am currently a senior studying Marketing and Communications Design at Washington University in St. Louis. Although my primary area of study is in business, I have a strong interest in art and design, and I strive to incorporate my skills from both areas to create well-designed business solutions.</p>

          <a href="work.html" class="btn btn-info btn-md" role="button">View my gallery! &raquo;</a>

          <br><br>
          <p>How do you communicate something clearly? How does an idea work for business needs? How can a design be executed effectively so that the core concept is understood and the consumer is interested? These are all questions that I tackle in my work. From sketching out a creative idea to working on product branding, problem solving is crucial in smart design. In my studio classes, each art project provides a new assignment, a new problem, and possible solutions. I am always trying to improve my skills and develop my sense in business and design.</p>

          <a href="contact.html" class="btn btn-info btn-md" role="button">Interested in working with me? Let's talk! &raquo;</a>

          <br><br><p>Feel free to browse my work and resume, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any project ideas, questions, concerns, or comments!</p>

  Welcome to Katherine's Website
  I'm learning the basics of web development so I wanted to create a website to showcase myself and my skills.

  I was born on September 16, 1992, in California. However, not longer after I was born, my family moved to Singapore, where I have spent the majority of my life. Now, I'm back in the US for college, going to school at Washington University in St. Louis, on track to receive a Bachelors in Business Administration. Being born in California but growing up in Singapore, and now going to school in the US makes me feel lost; they call us "Third Culture Kids" (google it!). I plan on staying in the US after I graduate, so I welcome any and all job opportunities that are located in the US! Even though I'm majoring in Finance and Marketing, I'm not entirely sure what exactly I want to do post-graduation. I will have some tough decisions ahead as I get closer to graduation.I am a freelance photographer. I picked up photography as a hobby and now I love taking pictures wherever I go! Now, I hope to pursue a career in the photography industry.

  Hi there, my name is Katherine Chen and you've found my personal website! I'm a current senior studying Marketing (major) and Communications Design (minor) at Washington University in St. Louis. I enjoy bringing my business and art knowledge together and using my passion for both areas to create well-designed business solutions, while continuing to explore and develop my skills. As someone who was born in the US but grew up in Asia, I consider my background somewhat confusing, but it has also allowed me to appreciate the nuances of different parts of life. All the experiences I have gone through inspire my work and what I do today. I also hope to continue growing and learning even in the future!
